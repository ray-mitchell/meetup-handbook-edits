Successful Meetup groups require an interested and active membership and a convenient venue where the membership can meet. Places like libraries, an office space after hours or a cafe can make for a great place for groups to meet. Oftentimes, there is no charge or a small charge (the price of a cup of coffee) for use of the space. However, this may not always be the case. At times it may be necessary to pay for the use of a meeting space; a sponsorship may help to defray the cost of a meeting venue.

A Few Words about Sponsorships

WordPress Meetups should be primarily about WordPress, supporting technologies and practical uses of the platform. Sponsorship arrangements shoould not change that focus. If in order to secure sponship your group needs to change its focus, making your Meetup feel less like an Open Source and WordPress meetup, think very carefully about continuing the sponsorship arrangement. Additionally, sponsorship is not about making a profit for your group. It is not about storing up resources, and it is not about providing high end, fancy spaces or food – it is simply about having your needs met. For a successful meetup, try to keep your needs modest so that your sponsorship needs are not exorbitant.


Tips for Approaching Sponsors

Sponsorships will be easiest to obtain when there is a benefit to the sponsor as well as the meetup group. The focus however should remain on the WordPress Meetup.

1. Ask. The best fit sponsors are not always going to come to you – and if they do approach you, it is important to consider their motivation prior to accepting their sponsorship. The ideal sponsorship comes from parties who understand and the community WordPress and are not just looking for another a platform for marketing their goods or services.
 
2. Approach sponsors with whom you have something in common or who would have a natural connection with your audience. 

3. Have a strong, professional sounding sponsorship email request or sales document outlining what your group is about and why you would be a strong fit for developing a sponsorship arrangement. If you look like you take it seriously, sponsors will take you seriously. 

4. If a sponsor decides to come on board, respect their branding on your website and in your communications about them. 

5. Keep in touch with your sponsor and even invite them to be a participant in the meetup and join the WordPress community. Sending them pictures of your Meetup can also keep them up to date with how they are helping you. Do not take their sponsorship for granted and see them as a cash dispenser. Build a relationship with them. As that relationship develops and continues, your mutual benefit grows with your group.
